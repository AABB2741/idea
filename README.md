# üß† Idea ‚Äì Notion Clone (Study Project)

**Idea** is a Notion-inspired productivity app built as a fullstack clone for learning purposes. It aims to replicate some of the core features of Notion, such as blocks, pages, nested structures, and rich content editing, across web and mobile platforms.

This project is not affiliated with Notion in any way.

## üìö About the Project

This project was created as a way to learn and practice fullstack development using modern tools and technologies. It is **not** intended to be a production-ready alternative to Notion, and it **will not** be monetized or promoted commercially.

The core objective is to explore:

- **React** for building the web interface
- **React Native** for the mobile experience
- **Node.js** and **Fastify** for building a performant backend API
- **Turborepo** for managing the monorepo setup efficiently
